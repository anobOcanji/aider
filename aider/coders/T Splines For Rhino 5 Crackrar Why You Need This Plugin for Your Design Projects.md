T Splines For Rhino 5 Crackrar uses a unique technology called T-Splines that allows you to create smooth surfaces with local control and minimal control points. Unlike NURBS surfaces, which are based on rectangular grids of control points, T-Splines surfaces can have any number of sides and can contain T-joints, where three or more edges meet at a point. This gives you more flexibility and freedom to create organic shapes that are difficult or impossible to model with NURBS.
 
T Splines For Rhino 5 Crackrar also has a user-friendly interface that lets you switch between box mode and smooth mode with the Tab key. In box mode, you can see the control points and edges of your model and manipulate them directly. In smooth mode, you can see the final result of your model and refine it with various tools, such as creases, extrusions, bridges and welds. You can also convert your T-Splines model to a NURBS or mesh model at any time with a single click.
