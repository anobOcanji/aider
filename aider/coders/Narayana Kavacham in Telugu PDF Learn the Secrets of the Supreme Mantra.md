Narayana Kavacham is a powerful stotra that invokes the protection of Lord Narayana, the supreme form of Lord Vishnu. It is said that Narayana Kavacham shields the devotee from all kinds of dangers and enemies, and bestows prosperity, peace and happiness. Narayana Kavacham was taught by Sage Vishwaroopa, the son of Tvashtri, to Indra, the king of gods, when he was threatened by the demons. Later, it was also taught by Sage Shuka, the son of Vyasa, to King Parikshit, the grandson of Arjuna, when he was cursed by a brahmana boy to die by a snake bite.
  
Narayana Kavacham consists of 24 verses that describe the various forms and attributes of Lord Narayana, such as Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Trivikrama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Kalki and others. It also prescribes the method of reciting the stotra with proper nyasa (placement of fingers on different parts of the body) and mantra (sacred syllables). The stotra begins with Om Namo Narayanaya, the eight-syllable mantra of Lord Narayana, and ends with Om Vishnave Namah, the salutation to Lord Vishnu.
